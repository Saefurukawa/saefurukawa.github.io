    <p>I am a first-year PhD student at Northeastern University where I am advised by Professor Alina Oprea. My research focuses on privacy-preserving machine learning, differential privacy, federated learning, and adversarial machine learning.</p>

    <p>I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Pomona College. During undergrad, I worked with Professor David Nembhard in the Human Analytics Lab and completed my undergraduate thesis with Professors David Kauchak and Eleanor Birrell on the differentially private federated fine-tuning of LLMs for hate speech detection. Previously, I interned at Apple, where I worked on on-device anomaly detection research.</p>
