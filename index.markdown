## Sae Furukawa
I am a first-year PhD student at Northeastern University where I am advised by Professor Alina Oprea. My research focuses on privacy-preserving machine learning, differential privacy, federated learning and adversarial machine learning.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Pomona College. During undergrad, I worked with Professor David Nembhard in the Human Analytics Lab and completed my undergraduate thesis with Professors David Kauchak and Eleanor Birrell on the differentially private federated fine-tuning of LLMs for hate speech detection. Previously, I interned at Apple, where I worked on the on-device anomaly detection research.
